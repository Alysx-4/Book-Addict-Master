<h2>Project Demo </h2>


<h2>Project Scope and Approach</h2>
<p>The scope of the project is to provide book addicts a platform to blog about their favourite books, why it is their favourite book and why it is recommended.<p>

<h2>Technology Used</h2>
<p>I used MONGODB as a database to store data from users who interact in the website. Node.js as my code editer as well as Express for my framework.Lastly, EJS as a simple template language.</p>

<h2>Difficulties and Outcomes</h2>
<p>THe biggest difficulty for me would be the backend of making this application because i understood how to do it based on the lecture notes but i did not know how to use them for my own project. It took me quite some time to go over everything thoroughly and try to apply it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, i managed to do what i wanted to do but it came with a cost - not having enough time for detailed adjustments. Nonetheless, i`m satisfied with the layout of the website.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<p>As a book reader myself, i would like to have a blog where i could share the titles of books that i have read so that other people would have a chance to also explore the type of books that are being published.</p>
